## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I was able to practice Flexbox. I struggled keeping the QR-code box at the center, while keeping the attribution at the bottom, but I was able to figure it out by using div containers and setting the QR section to Flex: 1.
